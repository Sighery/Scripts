## Introduction

This repository mainly contains scripts I have developed and that I'm working on. Some of them I've released already, while some I have not. Most of these scripts are released on [SteamGifts](https://www.steamgifts.com) and are made to work on that website only. However, some are just changes or small improvements to Steam. Some are just miscellaneous scripts for other websites, take a look at each or just ask me if you want to know more.

You are free to fork it and develop or change your own stuff, and then send a merge request if you want.

## Where you can find help

**Please note that NO support whatsoever will be given for those scripts on either a beta branch or the /dev/ folder. Those are work in progress and if I haven't released them yet it's because I don't have the time to both develop it and fix bugs and then help people who may having some problem using it.**

As for the rest, I'll make a list with the links to the SteamGifts threads in the order I released them:

* [AntiShitposting Script](https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3PVwH/)
* [Pagination at the Top](https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/Ju8nC/)
* [RaChartâ„¢ Enhancer](https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/riOvr/)
* [Find Those Bans](https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/nV9XP/)
* [Steam's True Review Count](https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/o8tEc/)

Exact information on what everything does is on those same linked threads, as well as some other useful info. Issues can either be reported here or in the corresponding thread. If you choose to post here, please mention which script are you referring to in the message of your issue. Also, when creating a new issue or making a post in one of my SG threads to ask for help, please give me the following info:
